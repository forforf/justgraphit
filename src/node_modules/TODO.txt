TODO:
* Use styles or themes rather than individual colors in Edit.js
* Simplify the logic, seems overly complicated
** We are often passing parent props through children to even lower components. Maybe abstract to a non-view module?
*** Specific example getLabeledObj in graphit.js
** Decide on where we will explictly pass the graph object as a prop vs pulling the last used graph from Storage
* There will soon be a <Layout> component to React, Use this for ... wait for it ... the layout.
* In Storage.js, Rename getLastKeyValue() to getLastStorageObj()
* Need robust error handling (user input, unexpected storage values, ability for user to recover etc)
